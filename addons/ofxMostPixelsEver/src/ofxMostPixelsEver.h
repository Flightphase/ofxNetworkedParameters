/**
 *  openFrameworks version of the popular synchronization system Most Pixels Ever by Dan Shiffman
 *  original repo: https://github.com/shiffman/Most-Pixels-Ever
 *  our fork: https://github.com/FlightPhase/Most-Pixels-Ever
 *
 *  I affectionately refer to as "Most Pickles Ever" since it's gotten me out of the most pickles. ever!
 * 
 *  Standing on the shoulders of the original creators:
 *  Dan Shiffman with Jeremy Rotsztain, Elie Zananiri, Chris Kairalla.
 *  Extended by James George on 5/17/11 @ Flightphase for the National Maritime Museum
 *
 *  Still need to convert the original examples to the new format
 * 
 *  There is a drawback that this is not compatible with the Java MPE jar, the connections must go OF client to OF Server
